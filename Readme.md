# ObjectPropertyMapper

Easy and powerful mapping of data to objects in Cocoa.


## Why?

NSJSONSerialization +JSONObjectWithData:options:error: returns a tree of simple instances (NSDictionary, NSArray,
NSString, NSNumber, etc.) but that data still needs to be mapped properties on objects.  That's what
ObjectPropertyMapper does.


## Requirements & External Dependencies

This project uses only standard Cocoa classes and has no external dependencies.


## Installation
Simply copy ObjectPropertyMapper.h and ObjectPropertyMapper.c to your project.
